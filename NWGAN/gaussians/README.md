# Normalized Wasserstein for generative models
We consider training generative models on mixture of Gaussians with imbalanced mixture proportion. 

## Installation
Code requires python3. Please install all packages in requirements.txt by running
 
` pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Training
To training NWGAN on mixture of gaussians, run

`
    python main.py --experiment mog
`

## Results
Generations produced by NWGAN:

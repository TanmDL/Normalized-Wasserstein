With Applications in Adversarial Learning and Domain Adaptation"


![Understanding normalized wasserstein](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~yogesh/projectpages/normalized_wasserstein/normalized_wasserstein_title.png)

We use Normalized Wasserstein measure for two applications
* Domain adaptation under covariate and label shift
* Generative modeling

Please refer to the README files on the respective folders on how to run the code.
